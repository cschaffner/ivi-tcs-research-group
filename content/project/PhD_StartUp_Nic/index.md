Have you ever wondered about the mathematical techniques that underpin the information revolution that, for example, allow you to read this website? Do you have a passion for mathematics and a desire to solve problems arising in the theoretical study of computation? Are you excited by the prospect of collaborating with other mathematically-inclined researchers to attack these questions? We are seeking a PhD student to carry out cutting-edge research in theoretical computer science (TCS).

One fundamental challenge that must be overcome to allow for the rapid communication we expect in modern life is that data transmissions must be protected from noise. Error-correcting codes (ECC’s) provide a mathematical means for adding judiciously chosen redundancy to messages to protect from errors. Intriguingly, the task of dealing with errors arises in many other areas of TCS, leading to a wealth of new applications for ECC’s together with novel design goals.

 
The Theory of Computer Science (TCS) group, within the Informatics Institute (IvI) of the University of Amsterdam (UvA), is looking for a PhD candidate with an expected research focus on coding theory and its interactions with other topics in TCS.
