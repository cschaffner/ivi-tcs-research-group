Are you fascinated by security in theory and/or practice? Are you willing to take on the challenge of securing the next generation of computer systems and networks? Do you like to work in a team of young researchers? Join our dynamic team as a Postdoctoral Researcher and contribute to ground-breaking research at the forefront of quantum technology!

 <!--more-->

Quantum technologies are advancing at an unprecedented pace. On one hand, the progress in developing quantum computers poses a significant threat to our security infrastructure, particularly concerning public-key cryptography. On the other hand, the integration of quantum communication and quantum data into our networks presents novel opportunities that can enhance security functionalities. However, at present, quantum components predominantly exist in experimental stages, and their security requires in-depth study and assessment.

 

Among the prominent applications of quantum networks is quantum key distribution (QKD), which theoretically offers superior security guarantees compared to classical cryptographic schemes. However, does the utilization of QKD truly provide tangible benefits over post-quantum cryptography? In the realistic context of trusted-node QKD networks, what kind of security guarantees can be proven depending on the deployed key-management system?

 

At a broader level, this postdoc position aims to investigate the advantages of exploiting quantum effects within the domain of security and explore the integration of quantum and classical security guarantees both in theory and practice.

 

The postdoc position will be within the Theory of Computer Science (TCS) group but will be carried out in close collaboration with researchers at QuSoft. The position is a part of the Quantum Delta NL growth fund project CAT-2, which focuses on the development of a national quantum network, and it will likely involve collaboration with the experimental and theoretical partners of the CAT-2 project.

 

## What are you going to do?
### Tasks and responsibilities
You are expected to:
* carry out original research in security, cryptography, quantum information processing and similar areas, resulting in academic publications in high-level international journals; present at leading conferences;
* have strong analytical and technical skills;
* have an interdisciplinary mindset and an open and proactive personality in interacting with researchers from different disciplines;
* take part in ongoing educational activities, such as assisting in a course and guiding student thesis projects, at the BSc or MSc level;
* interact with and co-supervise PhD students working on CAT-2 projects and related topics.
 

## What do you have to offer?
### Your experience and profile
We are looking for a candidate with:
* a PhD in computer science, mathematics, physics or a related field;
* a strong scientific interest in security, (post-quantum) cryptography, quantum information processing;
* strong academic performance, demonstrated by publications in international refereed academic journals and conferences;
* professional command of English and good presentation skills;
* the willingness to work collaboratively with other researchers.

## Our offer

We offer a temporary employment contract for 38 hours per week for a period of 12 months. The preferred starting date is as soon as possible. If we assess your performance positive, your contract will be extended with 24 months.

The gross monthly salary, based on 38 hours per week and dependent on relevant experience, ranges between € 2,960 to € 4,670 (scale 10). UvA additionally offers an extensive package of secondary benefits, including 8% holiday allowance and a year-end bonus of 8.3%. The UFO profile Researcher 4 is applicable. A favourable tax agreement, the ‘30% ruling’, may apply to non-Dutch applicants. The [Collective Labour Agreement of Universities of the Netherlands](https://www.universiteitenvannederland.nl/en_GB/cao-universiteiten.html) is applicable.

 

Besides the salary and a vibrant and challenging environment at Science Park we offer you multiple fringe benefits:
* 232 holiday hours per year (based on fulltime) and extra holidays between Christmas and 1 January;
* Multiple courses to follow from our Teaching and Learning Centre;
* A complete educational program for PhD students; Multiple courses on topics such as leadership for academic staff;
Multiple courses on topics such as time management, handling stress and an online learning platform with 100+ different courses;
* 7 weeks birth leave (partner leave) with 100% salary;
Partly paid parental leave;
* The possibility to set up a workplace at home;
* A pension at ABP for which UvA pays two third part of the contribution;
* The possibility to follow courses to learn Dutch;
* Help with housing for a studio or small apartment when you’re moving from abroad.

## About us

 

The [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/en/about-the-uva/about-the-university/about-the-university.html) is the Netherlands' largest university, offering the widest range of academic programmes. At the UvA, 42,000 students, 6,000 staff members and 3,000 PhD candidates study and work in a diverse range of fields, connected by a culture of curiosity.

 

The [Faculty of Science](https://www.uva.nl/en/faculty/faculty-of-science/faculty-of-science.html) has a student body of around 8,000, as well as 1,800 members of staff working in education, research or support services. Researchers and students at the Faculty of Science are fascinated by every aspect of how the world works, be it elementary particles, the birth of the universe or the functioning of the brain.

 

The mission of the [Informatics Institute (IvI)](https://ivi.uva.nl/) is to perform curiosity-driven and use-inspired fundamental research in Computer Science. The main research themes are Artificial Intelligence, Computational Science and Systems and Network Engineering. Our research involves complex information systems at large, with a focus on collaborative, data driven, computational and intelligent systems, all with a strong interactive component.


The [Theory of Computer Science (TCS)](https://ivi.fnwi.uva.nl/tcs/) group does research on the theoretical foundations of computer science. The aim is to seek greater understanding of fundamental computational techniques and their inherent limitations. You will be joining a growing and vibrant team of colleagues in Amsterdam all working in theoretical computer science from various UvA institutes such as IvI, the Institute for Logic, Language and Computation (ILLC), the Mathematics Institute (KdVI), but also the Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) and the Vrije Universiteit (VU). See [Theory.Amsterdam](https://theory.amsterdam) for an overview.
 

[QuSoft](https://qusoft.org) is the Dutch research Center for Quantum Software, a collaboration between the UvA and CWI. Its mission is to explore and develop uses of quantum computers and other quantum technologies, for the benefit of society. The researchers at QuSoft develop algorithms, software and applications that exploit the extraordinary power of quantum computers based on their quantum mechanical properties, such as superposition, interference and entanglement. That requires fundamentally different techniques and approaches from those used to develop conventional software.
