The goal of [Action Line 3 of QuantumDelta NL](https://quantumdelta.nl/human-capital/) is to create a quantum-versed work force. At the University of Amsterdam, we are in the process of setting up an entire new Master program on "Quantum Computer Science" (QuCS). These efforts are supported by Action Line 3.1 of QuantumDelta NL.

This project runs from September 2021 to September 2026.
