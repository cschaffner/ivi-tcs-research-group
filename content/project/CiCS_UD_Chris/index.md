## What are you going to do?
You will conduct research in the “Challenges in Cyber Security” project, one of the few projects receiving funding in the [prestigious NWO Gravitation program](https://www.uva.nl/en/content/news/news/2019/09/gravitation-grants-for-a-brain-atlas-challenges-in-cyber-security-and-ai-help-in-designing-blindness-therapy.html). In cooperation with researchers from TU Eindhoven, Radboud University, VU Amsterdam, and CWI, you will work on the grand challenges of cybersecurity in areas such as cryptography, software security, or physical security. Besides cutting-edge research, you will also contribute to education – for example, in the top-rated Security and Network Engineering MSc program – and other activities, including acquisition and management of funded research projects, supervision of PhD students, and supervision of BSc/MSc graduation projects.
 
### Tasks and responsibilities
You are expected to:
* conducting independent research in cyber security, resulting in academic publications in peer-reviewed, renowned international journals and conferences;
* actively pursuing external funding for research, notably funding from NWO (e.g., Veni), EU (e.g., ERC starting grant), or industry;
* contributing to the broad goals of the NWO gravitational project Challenges in Cyber Security, carrying out research, administrative and reporting tasks related to the project;
* fostering collaboration within the Informatics Institute, as well as with other partners on both national and international level;
* developing, coordinating and teaching courses in the bachelor and master programmes;
* supervising Bachelor and Master theses and tutoring students; co-supervising PhD theses;
* taking part in committees and working groups and carrying out outreach and departmental administrative tasks as directed.
 

## What do you have to offer?
### Your experience and profile
* PhD in Computer Science, Mathematics or a closely related field;
* a motivational lecturer with a passion for teaching;
* committed researcher, demonstrated by publications in relevant international top-tier conferences or journals;
* professional command of English and the willingness to learn Dutch;
* possession of the University Teaching Qualification, or the willingness to obtain it within two years after the start of the employment.

In addition, we highly value (but do not require) the following:
* experience in acquiring funding for research projects through government agencies or the private sector;
* experience in managing funded research projects;
* experience in supervising PhD research;
* high standing in the scientific community, as evidenced by, for example, membership in the program committee of prestigious international conferences;
* international network of relevant research cooperations;
* experience in supporting tasks and the willingness to take the responsibility for administrative tasks, such as organisation and coordination of university education and research.

## Our offer

We offer a temporary employment contract for 38 hours per week for a period of 18 months with a probationary period of two months. The preferred starting date is as soon as possible. A permanent contract follows if we assess your performance positive.

The gross monthly salary, based on 38 hours per week and dependent on relevant experience, ranges between € 4,492 to € 6,148 (scale 11). UvA additionally offers an extensive package of secondary benefits, including 8% holiday allowance and a year-end bonus of 8.3%. The UFO profile UD2 is applicable.

The [Collective Labour Agreement of Universities of the Netherlands](https://www.universiteitenvannederland.nl/en_GB/cao-universiteiten.html) is applicable.

 

Besides the salary and a vibrant and challenging environment at Science Park, we offer you multiple fringe benefits:
* 232 holiday hours per year (based on fulltime) and extra holidays between Christmas and 1 January;
* Multiple courses to follow from our Teaching and Learning Centre;
* Multiple courses on topics such as leadership for academic staff;
* Multiple courses on topics such as time management, handling stress and an online learning platform with 100+ different courses;
* 7 weeks birth leave (partner leave) with 100% salary;
* Partly paid parental leave;
* The possibility to set up a workplace at home;
* A pension at ABP for which UvA pays two third part of the contribution;
* The possibility to follow courses to learn Dutch;

## About us


The [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/en/about-the-uva/about-the-university/about-the-university.html) is the Netherlands' largest university, offering the widest range of academic programmes. At the UvA, 42,000 students, 6,000 staff members and 3,000 PhD candidates study and work in a diverse range of fields, connected by a culture of curiosity.

 

The [Faculty of Science](https://www.uva.nl/en/faculty/faculty-of-science/faculty-of-science.html) has a student body of around 8,000, as well as 1,800 members of staff working in education, research or support services. Researchers and students at the Faculty of Science are fascinated by every aspect of how the world works, be it elementary particles, the birth of the universe or the functioning of the brain.

 

The mission of the [Informatics Institute (IvI)](https://ivi.uva.nl/) is to perform curiosity-driven and use-inspired fundamental research in Computer Science. The main research themes are Artificial Intelligence, Computational Science and Systems and Network Engineering. Our research involves complex information systems at large, with a focus on collaborative, data driven, computational and intelligent systems, all with a strong interactive component.

 

The Theory of Computer Science (TCS) group does research on the theoretical foundations of computer science. The aim is to seek greater understanding of fundamental computational techniques and their inherent limitations. You will be joining a growing and vibrant team of colleagues in Amsterdam all working in theoretical computer science from various UvA institutes such as IvI, the Institute for Logic, Language and Computation (ILLC), the Korteweg de Vries Institute (KdVI) on mathematics, but also the Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) and the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (VU). See [Theory.Amsterdam](https://theory.amsterdam) for an overview.
