We are happy to announce the hiring of John van de Wetering as new assistant professor in the theory of computer science group. 

**John van de Wetering** (PhD Radboud University 2020), currently postdoc at Oxford University, will join the TCS group at the Informatics Institute in December 2022. John is an expert in diagrammatic techniques in quantum computation such as ZX-calculus. John is the cocreator of the open source optimising [quantum compiler PyZX](https://github.com/Quantomatic/pyzx), a Python tool for using the ZX-calculus on quantum circuits. He also works on quantum foundations with the goal of better understanding the nature of quantum mechanics through algebraic and compositional methods.
