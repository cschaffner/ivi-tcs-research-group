### Abstract
List decoding allows the error-correction procedure to output a small list of candidate codewords, and the decoding is deemed successful if the list includes the original uncorrupted codeword. List decoding has enjoyed a number of influential consequences. It allows bridging between the Shannon and Hamming worlds and achieving "capacity" even in worst-case error models. It serves as a versatile subroutine in varied error-correction scenarios not directly tied to list decoding. It boasts a diverse array of "extraneous" applications in computational complexity, combinatorics, cryptography, and quantum computing. And it has infused several novel algebraic, probabilistic, combinatorial, and algorithmic techniques and challenges into coding theory.

This talk will provide a glimpse of several facets of list decoding, its origins, evolution, constructions, connections, and applications.
