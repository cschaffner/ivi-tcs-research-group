We are happy to announce the hiring of three new faculty members in Theoretical Computer Science (TCS) at the University of Amsterdam, thereby further growing the active community of TCS researchers in Amsterdam.

Rebecca Reiffenh√§user and Balder ten Cate are joining the Institute for Logic, Language and Computation (ILLC), and Nicolas Resch is joining the Theory of Computer Science group at the Informatics Institute, all at the Faculty of Science (FNWI) of the UvA.

**Nicolas Resch** (PhD Carnegie Mellon University, 2020), currently postdoc at CWI Amsterdam, will join the TCS group at the Informatics Institute in September 2022. Nic is an expert in coding and information theory, and he is working in the intersection of coding theory and cryptography, with the goal of designing efficient quantum-secure cryptographic protocols.
