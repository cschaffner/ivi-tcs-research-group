Dr John van de Wetering (Informatics): Diagrams for simulating quantum computers and more
<br>
I will use a language of diagrams, the ZX-calculus, to unify different approaches to simulating quantum computations, which will allow for larger simulations. I will then use the connection of quantum simulation to condensed-matter physics and logical-formula solving to find areas where these improved techniques will lead to better algorithms. In this way we bring these fields closer together.
