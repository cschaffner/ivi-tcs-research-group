Hi this is Sarah! I joined TCS in April 2024, and my doctoral research focuses on quantum compilation and fault-tolerant quantum computation.

During Master's study, I explored different aspects of quantum compiling, such as logical circuit characterization and synthesis, NISQ optimization, and graphical derivation of fault-tolerant protocols. In undergrad, I studied families of Clifford+T circuits from a number-theoretic perspective. Beyond that, I was trained in quantum circuit synthesis and optimization.
