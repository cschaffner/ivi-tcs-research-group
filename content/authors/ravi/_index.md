# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
# bio: The complexity of man made systems on all scales is my research field. Cyber Infrastructure is rapidly evolving from relatively simple fixed components to programmable and virtualized objects with many degrees of freedom, owned,  operated and governed by different entities in multiple administrative connected domains on the Internet. Harnessing this complexity in a transparent trust-able way for safe and secure data processing is a major research topic that nowadays defines the focus in my research. I chair the Complex Cyber Infrastructure research group that hosts this research line.

## About Divya:

I joined the UvA as an Assistant Professor in October 2023. Prior to this, I was a post-doctoral researcher in the Cryptography and Security Group at Aarhus University, Denmark.  I received my PhD at Indian Institute of Science (IISc), India where I was supervised by Dr. Arpita Patra. 

My research currently focuses on finding solutions to intriguing questions such as the feasibility of tasks related to secure multiparty computation (MPC) and construction of efficient MPC protocols under different settings of network and computational models.
