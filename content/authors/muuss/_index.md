I am a doctoral researcher in (post)-quantum cryptography starting in October 2023.
Before, I did my Bachelor and Master's in Computer Science at the University of Bonn, specializing in IT-Security and including some excursions in mathematics and physics.
My Masterâ€™s thesis was in the area of foundations of quantum computing, with a focus on utilizing diagrammatic methods for evaluating NISQ algorithms.
Currently, I focus on analyzing the quantum security of memory-hard functions, you can find more details on the project on the [QSI page](https://qsi.uvigo.es/project/quantum-security-of-memory-hard-functions/).
