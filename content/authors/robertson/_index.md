Hello! My name is Ailsa (pronounced 'Elsa') and I joined as a PhD student here in November 2023. I am primarily a member of the Theoretical Computer Science group (TCS) within IvI. Additionally, I'm a member of the QuSoft group at the CWI, and of the HPP/EPS group within the ILLC.

My research activity has two forms. Primarily, I am central to a project called the Quantum Impact on Societal Security (QISS); you can read more about that [here](https://ivi.fnwi.uva.nl/tcs/project/qiss/).

Alongside the QISS project, I conduct fundamental research within Quantum Safe Cryptography.
