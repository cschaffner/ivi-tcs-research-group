Hi! I'm Sebastian, I joined the Theory of Computer Science (TCS) Group on May 13th as a Postdoc, supervised by Christian Schaffner. After a PhD at the Institute of Quantum Computing in Waterloo (Canada), I joined the electro-optical communication group in Eindhoven to work on QKD for two years. Here I will continue my research on (quantum) cryptography.
