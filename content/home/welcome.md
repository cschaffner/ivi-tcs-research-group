The **Theory of Computer Science (TCS) Group** does research on the theoretical foundations of computer science. The aim is to seek greater understanding of fundamental computational techniques and their inherent limitations.
The TCS group forms an integral part of a [vibrant community of TCS researchers in Amsterdam](https://theory.amsterdam).
